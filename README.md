### Why do some drivers crash?
The lifetime odds of dying in car crash are <b>1 in 103</b>. Each year, vehicles crashes cost <b> hundreds of billions </b> of dollars. Research shows that <b> driver behavior </b> is the key to understanding why automobile accidents occur. It's a primary factor in 66% of crashes and a contributing factor in 90% of crashes. However, driver behavior is one of the <i>most difficult</i> things to study. 

<b>In-cabin driver video data</b> has the potential to enhance our understanding of accidents and provide greater context for interpretation, but brings forward important questions about responsible data science and the future of research.

 >How might we gain insights from vehicle driver video -- while preserving privacy? Specifically, to what extent is it possible to de-identify driver facial video data -- in a way that maintains useful information about driver behavior?

### The challenge
This challenge aims to surface the latest privacy-preserving video processing and analytics techniques by studying a test set of driver video data that uses the same data acquisition system as the SHRP 2 dataset.

The <b>SHRP 2 dataset</b> was collected as part of the <b>Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS)</b> and contains <b> millions of hours and petabytes of driver video data</b> that can be used by researchers to gain a better understanding about the underlying causes of car crashes.

The dataset is currently <b> hosted in a secure enclave</b> due to privacy concerns about the identities of the drivers used in the study. The data studied in this challenge is similar to the SHRP 2 dataset but the privacy concerns and participant submissions are applicable in a much broader context of the driver safety research community.
